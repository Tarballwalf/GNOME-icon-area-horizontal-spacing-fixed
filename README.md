# GNOME-center-area-horizontal-spacing-fixed
Reduce the horizontal spacing between icons in the top-left icon area. 
Fork of the "Status Area Horizontal Spacing" extension, but for the CENTER area. 

Original extension can be hound [here](https://gitlab.com/p91paul/status-area-horizontal-spacing-gnome-shell-extension).

Sadly, this project is no longer maintained, since I have stopped using GNOME and switched to KDE.
